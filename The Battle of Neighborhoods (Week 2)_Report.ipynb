    "## 1. Introduction: Business Problem \n",
    "This report provides guidance for stakeholders intereseted in opening an resturant in Toronto, Canada. Specifically, the report analyizes existing popular venues and population of neighborhoods in the city of Toronto and identifies a set of location candidates for a new resturant in the city. The location candidates will be as close to the city center as possible, meeting other conditions. Interested stkeholders can choose the final location candidate(s) suitable for their new resturants depending on types of restaurant such as Italian, Indian, and Japanese among the few promissing neighborhoods this report provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data \n",
    "This report considers the following factors in order to perform the optimum analysis and deliver the conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Existing restaurants of any type in the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto\n",
    "- Population of the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto\n",
    "- Distance of each neighborhood from the city center\n",
    "\n",
    "The following data are used for analyzing neighborhoods in the city of Toronto including finding top venues in each neighborhood, clustering the neighborhoods, creating a map based on such clusters, and examing ach cluster.¶\n",
    "1. Wikipedia data to obtain neighborhoods profiles including the neighrhood population.\n",
    "Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Foursquare data to obtain resturant/venue information.\n",
    "Link: https://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&ne=44.418088%2C-78.362732&q=Restaurant&sw=42.742978%2C-80.554504\n",
    "\n",
    "The report uses the regularly spaced grids of locations, centered around the city center, in defining the neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology used herein includes:\n",
    "- finding top venues in each neighborhood;\n",
    "- clustering the neighborhoods;\n",
    "- creating a map based on such clusters; and\n",
    "- examing ach cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the clustering of the neighborhoods, “K-Means Clustering Algorithm\" has been applied. K-Means Clustering Algorithmis a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number of groups represented by the variable K. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity. The results of the K-means clustering algorithm are the centroids of the K clusters, which can be used to label new data labels for the training data (each data point is assigned to a single cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed steps includes:\n",
    "- Collectiing dataset including location and type (or category) of each restaurant within the designated latitude and longitude;\n",
    "- Exploring the restaurant density across the different geographic areas by using K-Mean; and\n",
    "- Finding the most promising areas within the created clusters of locations with less resturants in radius of 500 meters of the city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Analysis\n",
    "### 4.1 Identifiing, capturing, and cleaning data\n",
    "First, the Wikipedia data is identified, and the city profile is captured. Any redundant value is then removed to create clean data ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Combining datasets and sorting neighborhoods\n",
    "The neighborhood dataset is combined with the postal address data and the latitude and longitude data. The resultant dataset (or data frame) contains the details including Postal Code, Brough, Neighborhood, Latitude & Longitude. This datase is visualized by Folium map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Exploring the Toronto's neighborhoods\n",
    "Neighborhoods in the created dataset are explored based on the latitude and longitude and the corresponding resturant venue information included in the Foresquare data. Unique categories in the neighbohoods are further explored, and the top 10 venues in each neighrhood were identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Clustering\n",
    "Five different clusters with a similar set of venues are identified using K-Means Clustering Algorithm with an assumption of five clusters. Each cluster is explored, and any discriminating venue categories that distinguish each cluster are determined. The clusters and Boroughs/Neighborhoods with the maximum number of restaurants and their types are identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Results and Discussion \n",
    "There are four (4) boroughs and thirty-nine (39) neighborhoods centered around the geograpical coordinate of Toronto, Latitude 43.6534817 and Longitude -79.3839347. The four boroughs are: Downtown Toronto; Central Toronto; East Toronto; and West Toronto. Some example neighborhoods are: St.James Town and Bercyz Park in Downtown Toronto; Lawrence Park and Roselawn in Central Toronto; The Beaches in East Toronto; and Parkdale in West Toronto. These boroughs and neighborhoods have some congested areas with a relatively high density of the existing restaurants and blue ocean areas with a low restaurant density.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters with the maximum number of resturants and restaurant types within the respective neighborhoods may have high demands for restaurants in the corresponding areas, which can be regarded as popular areas with business opportunities and with competition. Clusters 2 and 4 have a higher number of the existing resturants than the rest of the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is entirely possible that there are reasons for the areas to have only a small number of restaurants, while there are good reasons for the congested areas. A new and good restaurant may, however, draw new customers to such \"slow\" areas and create new businesses therein. The already-busy areas will surely cast high competition to a new restaurant with the existing restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion \n",
    "As discussed, there are pros and cons in both the condensed areas and the less condensed ares when it comes to opening a new restaurant. A final decision on an otimal location for a new resturant should be made by each stakeholder based on an anticipated business model, taking into consideration various factors. One may prefer the already popular location and venue and face the direct competition with the existing restaurants, while one may look into blue ocean with much creativity to win a new business opportunity. Whichever business model is chosen, hopefully this analysis and report gives some guidance to furture restaurant owners."
